Things to do to resurrect:

[ ] Integrate `www` content into the vega-strike.org website as a sub-website (vega-strike.org/black-paralysis) (see `imported` branch)
[ ] Figure out what to do with the `resources` folder (see `imported` branch)
[X] Move everything under `black-paralysis` into the root
[ ] Migrate from Autotools to CMake
[ ] Update against the 0.9.x VS Engine
[ ] Map/import the sounds files from VS:UtCS and update the resources

NOTE: The VSU:BP game was last worked on in 2007. The only release was Sept 2005. There is likely
a very large gap between the state of the VS Engine (version 0.4.3, June 2005; 0.4.9 October, 2007)
and where we are today.
